Wordle Backup
# Purpose
I made this repo to preserve the game in its current state as recently [The New York Times have acquired it](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1488263944309731329) and may possibly pay-wall it. I do not intend to steal the game or take credit for something that is not mine. All credit goes to Josh Wardle for creating Wordle.
